# Crypto Currencies
## Module 19 - Unsupervised Machine Learning
For this Challenge we used a Crypto Currency Data set.

## The Purpose of this Module was to help understand unsupervised algorithms.

I learned the following:
- How to describe the differences between supervised and unsupervised learning.
- How to preprocess data for unsupervised learning.
- Cluster data using the K-means algorithm.
- Determine the best number of centroids for K-means using the elbow curve.
- Use PCA to limit features and speed up the model.
- Creating 3D graphs using Plotly and hvPlot
- K-means vs. Hierarchial Clustering
- Dendrograms

Resources: Scikit-learn, Plotly, hvplot, and Jupyter Notebook (Pandas).
